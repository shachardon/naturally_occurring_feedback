There are two different patterns in user feedback subsequent to assistant utterances:
Repeat or Rephrase (UR1) - The user repeats or rephrases their concern, e.g., Actually, I wanted ...
Positive Feedback (UR5) - The user confirms that the assistant did a good job by directly saying so or thanking it, e.g., Thank you

Given these guidelines, please recognize such user responses in the following dialogue, and state your level of confidence. Please use the format:
{
"User Response Pattern": [Insert User Response Pattern],
"User Response Text": [Insert User Response Text],
"Confidence Level (1-5)": [Insert Confidence Level]
}

If there is no feedback, use the following format:
{
"User Response Pattern": "No Feedback",
"User Response Text": "",
"Confidence Level (1-5)": [Insert Confidence Level]
}
